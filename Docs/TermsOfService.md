# WellnessCheck Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** January 20, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 20, 2026

---

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using WellnessCheck ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

WellnessCheck is developed and operated by Stricklin Development, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), based in San Antonio, Texas.

---

## 2. Description of Service

WellnessCheck is a safety monitoring application designed to help people living independently stay connected with designated contacts ("Care Circle"). The App monitors for:

- Periods of inactivity on your device
- Potential falls (using device motion sensors)
- Deviations from your normal activity patterns

When certain thresholds are exceeded and you do not respond to check-in prompts, the App may send SMS alerts to your Care Circle members.

---

## 3. THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE

**IMPORTANT: WellnessCheck is NOT a medical device, emergency response system, or substitute for professional medical care.**

- The App CANNOT detect medical emergencies, heart attacks, strokes, or other health conditions
- The App CANNOT guarantee detection of falls or other incidents
- The App does NOT contact 911 or emergency services
- The App does NOT replace medical alert systems, Life Alert, or similar services

**WellnessCheck helps people find out sooner—not instantly.** Response times depend entirely on your settings, your Care Circle members' availability, and their ability to take action.

If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately.
